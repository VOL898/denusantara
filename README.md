# De'Nusantara

This project is for my Software Engineering class project in Binus University Semester 4 as part of the entrepreneurship aspects of it. In fact, this project is still being continued in semester 5 for my Entrepreneurship: Market Validation class. This project is done along 2 other teammates. 

In this project, we were asked to create something that was unique, and we thought of De'Nusantara which is a mobile app that was able to provide recipes based on the ingredients the user has around them. The user would also be able to search for their own recipes and perform recipe scaling where the recipe can be adjusted to the required portions of the user. Moreover, we plan to use content based to create a recommendation system to recommend recipes based on the users preferences. However, for now, we will only be working on the UI as creating such an app would require more budget and time, especially to code the recommendation system.
